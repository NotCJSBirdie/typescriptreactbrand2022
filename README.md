#TypeScriptReact Brand 2022

Remember, this is just the version 1.

I just finished watching and doing the hands-on project of the Traversy Media TypescriptC Crash Course and it was so awesome since I really understood the Typescript Programming language in it's finest.

Since I am using React Framework I don't have to use the manual way of compiling Typescript to Javascript.

But if I am dealing with vanilla Javascript Projects I would be dealing with 'tsc' command in the terminal!

And also for me not to type every single time I should to use the 'tsc --watch' command in the terminal which was great if I am dealing vanilla Javascript.

# IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT TYPESCRIPT!

Since Typescript is just an extension of Javascript, every single thing that Javascript is, belongs in Typescript but more features are added. I added a repository in my github regarding the core features of typescript especially when you are dealing with vanilla javascript Projects!
